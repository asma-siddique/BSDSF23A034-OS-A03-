# ROLL_NO-OS-A03: Custom UNIX Shell

## Description
This project is a simple command-line shell written in C, similar to Bash or Zsh.  
It allows the user to execute external commands, manage processes, and practice basic shell functionalities such as tokenization, process creation, and execution.

The shell was built as part of an Operating Systems course assignment, providing hands-on experience with:

- `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()` system calls  
- Parsing and tokenizing user input  
- Executing built-in and external commands  
- Handling background processes (future extensions)
